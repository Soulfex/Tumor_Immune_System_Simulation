A simulation of the interaction between a tumor and the immune system. 

It's still in the works, so far the dynamics that we get resembles a control system, where immune complexes oscillate in order to keep the number of cancer cells approximately constant.

Here's a video of how the simulation looks like:

<ul>
<li>Purple cells are T-cells that are inactive and move randomly</li>
<li>Red cells are T-cells that have been activated, and move by chemotaxis</li>
<li>Green cells are proliferating cancer cells</li>
<li>Blue cells are cancer cells that have been "trapped" by the immune system (immune complexes)</li>
</ul>
