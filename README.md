A simulation of the interaction between a tumor and the immune system. 

Here's a video of what the simulation looks like:

<ul>
<li>Yellow dots are cancer cells that have not been marked by the immune system.</li>
<li>Red cells are T-cells that are exploring their environment randomly, and have not been activated.</li>
<li>Blue cells are cancer cells that have been trapped by immune cells.</li>
<li>Green cells are T-cells that have been activited, and move through chemotaxis towards regions that present inflammation.</li>
</ul>
