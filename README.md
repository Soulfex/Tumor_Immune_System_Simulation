A simulation of the interaction between a tumor and the immune system. 

It's still in the works, so far the dynamics that we get resembles a control system, where immune complexes oscillate in order to keep the number of cancer cells approximately constant.

Here's a video of how the simulation looks like:

<ul>
<li>Yellow dots are cancer cells that have not been marked by the immune system.</li>
<li>Red cells are T-cells that are exploring their environment randomly, and have not been activated.</li>
<li>Blue cells are cancer cells that have been trapped by immune cells.</li>
<li>Green cells are T-cells that have been activited, and move through chemotaxis towards regions that present inflammation.</li>
</ul>
